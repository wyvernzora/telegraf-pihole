# Upper limit on the number of log entries to gather in a single polling cycle
# When starting a fresh plugin instance on an existing database, having a batch limit larger than
# Telegraf buffer size will cause log entries to be dropped. This setting allows limiting of the number
# of log entries in a single cycle so that Telegraf can "gently catch up".
#
# When running on Pihole instances that may receive more requests than batch size limit in a single poll
# interval, enable the `gather_plugin_metrics` setting and monitor the lag metric that measures how far
# behind the log processing is.

# When lag metric is too large (> 60s + poll_interval), increase telegraf buffer size, batch size and this
# config option.
